            <p>
                I am a nonbinary 24 year old currently living in Waldo, FL. I have spent most of my life in FL, but I hope to return to Philly soon.
                My favorite hockey team is the Philadelphia Flyers, and I used to live there with my best friend. 
                Alongside being in the Grace Hopper bootcamp, I am a Social Work major at the University of North Florida and a Deli Clerk at Publix.
                My freetime mostly consits of crocheting and spending time with my friends, family, and cats. 
                My cats are a huge part of my life, I love them dearly.

                <p>Cassiopeia "Cassi" and Rogue "Ro" are 5 years old sisters from the same litter. 
                    People often mistake them as the same cat, but they couldn't be more different.
                    Ro has never met a stranger, if anyone offers to pet her they are quickly her new bff. Her favorite toys are none of the ones I've purchased for her, but instead my socks! She likes to carry them around and sometimes offer it to me as a present.
                    Cassi is much more shy, but  nonetheless loving. She loves to cuddle with me every night and also during class. She is very sassy though. She loves to scream until i pick her up and give her a hug, or if i move slightly while she is cuddling with me.
                    Physically, they do look rather similas. Both have all white incredibly soft bellies, bright yellowgreen eyes, and long beautiful whiskers.
                    Cassi's fur has many patches of grey with darker grey stripes, orange some with darker orange stripes, and solid white. Her face has more white on it than her sister's. 
                    Ro has bigger patches of grey with dark grey stripes, and smaller pathces of oranage and white. She is a little bit bigger too.

            <p>
                I have been crocheting for many years. My granny is a life long artist, and began teaching me at the age of 6. In the beginning, I never started or finished my own projects but my granny was there to help me every step of the way.
                My relationship with her has always been very special. She has always been my biggest supporter, even when I didn't believe in myself. 
                Through middle and high school, I was inconsistent with how often I practiced. When I moved away to Philly as an adult, I missed my family and began crocheting more consitently to feel closer. 
                It's been three years since then and having this hobby brings me so much joy both for the time to relax and create and the projects that come out of it.
                I have created many baby blankets stitched with love for family and friends. I also made a (very oversized) cardigan for my best friend's birthday after he moved to Colorado.
                I hope to use this joy for creating to help inspire future projects.
