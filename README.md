#Personal Website Project
index.html is going to be my homepage
abot.html is the about me section. In this section I will include my cats and hobby.
portfolio.html will have two projects I have worked on, need to add github link
I want to have a persistent nav bar.
I'd like to play with fonts but I'm not sure I will have time.
