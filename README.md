# Personal Website Project

index.html is my homepage. I gave the picture better margin between it and text box. Its simple but I like it.
abot.html is the about me section. In this section I will include my cats and hobby. Done, i like the set up but can always use improvement.
portfolio.html will have two projects I have worked on, need to add github link. Links added, next step is better formatting.
I want to have a persistent nav bar, done. I made two.
<!-- I'd like to play with fonts but I'm not sure I will have time. -->
Contact form is complete, could be formatted better to be centered, but not a priority currently.
I am prioritizing the baseline requirements before styling further. I allowed some scope creep by adding the footer.
